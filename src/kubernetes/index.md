# Kubernetes

As previously mentioned, kubernetes deployments are only recommended for people with good prior operating experience of kubernetes.

The management of substrate/polkadot based nodes in kubernetes is made very easy with:

- [Parity Helm Chart](./kubernetes/helm.md) a helm chart to deploy all types of nodes to kubernetes

- [Testnet Manager](./helm/testnetmanager.md) a powerful tool for deploying and maintaining test networks in kubernetes.
